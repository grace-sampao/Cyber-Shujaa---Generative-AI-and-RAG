## 🌟 Overview

### The assignment 🎯

In this assignment, we applied our understanding of **Generative AI** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to build a practical pipeline that retrieves relevant document chunks and generates context-aware answers.

By completing this assignment, we demonstrated our ability to:

- Apply generative AI concepts to synthesize answers from retrieved document content.
- Extract key information from a PDF document by splitting it into chunks, embedding it using Sentence-Transformers, and storing it in a FAISS vector database for efficient retrieval.
- Demonstrate how retrieval improves generative question-answering by comparing answers generated from document-grounded context versus generic answers.
- Implement a complete RAG pipeline in Python using LangChain, Hugging Face Transformers, and FAISS.
- Practice prompt engineering to structure queries that guide the generative model for clearer and more detailed responses.

We were to complete the following tasks:

1.	Upload the document.pdf in the same folder as our code
2.	Split the document into chunks
3.	Create embeddings in the Vector store
4.	Add LLM of choice
5.	Query using RAG
